      <p>Herein lies accounts of the major people of the Nevaria whether it be for political, cultural, or historical importance:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><h2>Pontius, The Golden King</h2></dt>
        <dd><p>The king of the central most island mapped on the Nevarian atlases. Many regard him to be the king of all of Nevaria.<br>
            He was made king after he sealed the Lich King Lodrin in an a tomb of eternal rest during The War of the Lich King.<br>
            Pontius is well respected by most all of the inhabitants of Nevaria for his great heroism and benevolence yet there<br>
            are still those who revile him.</p>
