        <dt><h2>The War of the Elves</h2></dt>
        <dd><p>During the Age of Creation (known also as the first age by some), the first race to inherit the earth were the elves.<br>
                They were charged by the gods to care of the natural resources of the world, but with this they grew proud and greedy.<br>
                Two factions of elves began to form, the elves of the west formed under the banner of the Silver Queen. The elves of the
                east formed under the banner of the Iron Lord.<br><br>

                At the apex of the war the two sides had fought their way deep into the mountains. A great winter storm took hold of the
                two armies. The forces of the Silver Queen retreated into caves to protect them from the storm. The forces of the Iron King
                were caught in the midst of the storm. Through some curse of the gods both sides ended up transformed into two new subraces
                of elves, the Dark Elves and the Frost Elves.<br><br></p></dd>
