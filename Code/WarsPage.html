        <p>Herein lies accounts of the many wars that have shaped and defined the history of Nevaria:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><h2>The War of the Elves</h2></dt>
        <dd><p>During the Age of Creation (known also as the first age by some), the first race to inherit the earth were the elves.
                They were charged by the gods to care of the natural resources of the world, but with this they grew proud and greedy.
                Two factions of elves began to form, the elves of the west formed under the banner of the Silver Queen. The elves of the
                east formed under the banner of the Iron Lord.<br><br>

                At the apex of the war the two sides had fought their way deep into the mountains. A great winter storm took hold of the
                two armies. The forces of the Silver Queen retreated into caves to protect them from the storm. The forces of the Iron King
                were caught in the midst of the storm. Through some curse of the gods both sides ended up transformed into two new sub-races
                of elves, the Dark Elves and the Frost Elves. This war marked the end of the Age of Creation.<br><br></p></dd>

        <dt><h2>The War of the Lich King</h2></dt>
        <dd><p>During the Age of Destruction (known also as the second age by some), the Frost Elves and the Dark Elves retreated to
                the far corners of the mortal realm. With the elves seceding from their role of caring for the earth others tried to
                take on this role. The Dwarves arose from under the earth to try and restore life to the war-torn world. Humans from
                far across the sea began to colonize the now empty capital island of Ciradell. Not all those who saw this opportunity
                intended to use it for good, however.<br><br>

                One man, by the name of Lodrin, saw the rich magical resources of Ciradell and he wanted them for himself. He began
                to research ways to sap Mana from objects and beings. This started with simply plants and gems, but he soon grew mad
                with a hunger for Mana. He began to develop methods to absorb the Mana from even the most powerful Mages. With assistance
                From his brothers, Hadun and Naudric, he developed ways to control people drained of Mana like puppets. The three brothers
                rose against all other mortal beings and began to take control of Ciradell with eyes aimed for all of Nevaria.<br><br>

                Resistance groups of clerics and warriors began to form, searching desperately for ways to combat Lodrin. Lodrin was dubbed
                the Lich King by these groups which is a name that he himself took a liking too. The Druids of Mamoa began to work on methods
                to rejuvenate the land with Mana. Lodrin sent out hordes of his undead slaves to combat these druids which led to the resistance
                beginning an all out war, a war that ravaged the land and lasted decades.
