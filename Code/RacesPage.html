    <h1>The Races of Nevaria</h1>
    <p>Nevaria is home to a wildly diverse range of races with different physical and cultural characteristics as well as different sub-races
        in some cases. Some of these races were created by the gods and others were born from the abyss, others still were the effect of
        breeding between the races or magical interference.<br>

        Below is a list of the many races that inhabit Nevaria:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><h2>Elves</h2></dt>
        <dd>Elves come in one of the widest varieties of all the races of Nevaria. In general, elves are known for their slender and tall build,
            They are the direct descendents of the Fey gods and were the original inheritors of Nevaria. Because of their Fey ancestry, Elves are
            an immortal and generally super human race.<br><br>

            <h3>Sub-races of the Elves</h3>
            <ul><strong>The Dark Elves:</strong><p> The Dark Elves were one of the races spawned from the War of the Elves. They were spawned from
                    a curse that was cast upon them by the Fey as a punishment for their evil behaviour. They have forever warped into a
                    different variety of elf. They are known for their red or purple eyes and their intensely pale skin that has a strange
                    lavender hue to it at times. Dark Elves are sometimes also called Blood elves since many of them are known for vampirism.
                    Many Dark Elves still serve the Silver Queen as her loyal subject and they often hold intense hatred against Frost Elves.</p>
                <strong>The Frost Elves:</strong><p> The Frost Elves were the other race spawned from the War of the Elves from the same curse that
                        warped the Dark Elves. The Frost Elves are known for their blue eyes and having pale skin with just a hint of light blue as
                        well giving them the a chilled look. Frost Elves require the blood of other creatures to survive, thus many of them are
                        vampiric in a similar vein to Dark Elves. Frost Elves posess superhuman strength and agility, making them terrible foes to face.</p>
                <strong>The Sand Elves:</strong><p></p></ul></dd>
