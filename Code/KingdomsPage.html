        <h1>Kingdoms of Nevaria</h1>
        <p>Many kingdoms have inhabited Nevaria over the ages and some of them have sat on the outskirts of other realms
            thought their influences often seep into the history of Nevaria. Below is a list of the major kingdoms.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><h2>The Golden Kingdom</h2></dt>
            <dd><ul>
                <li><strong>Capital:</strong> Ciradell, The Golden City</li>
                <li><strong>Ruler:</strong> King Pontius</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Deity:</strong> Judicus, God of Justice</li>
                <p>The Golden Kingdom is known across the land as the most benevolent and just kingdom. They offer protection
                    to all of their people and to all of the neighbouring lands around them. Many people consider Pontius to
                    be the King of all Nevaria, some find this dubbing blasphemous.<br><br>

                    They are known for their great ocean fleets, their navy are referred to as the Justicars of the Seas.
                    Although they have a strong military force they use it only to fight evil as it arises. Great demons
                    and beasts from the Abyss or ancient serpents of the depths. Besides that the Golden Kingdom typically
                    frowns upon the idea of war, though they will fight to protect themselves and their allies.</p>
            </ul></dd>

            <dt><h2>The Silver Empire</h2></dt>
            <dd><ul>
                <li><strong>Capital:</strong> Alu'Daea, The Silver City</li>
                <li><strong>Ruler:</strong> The Silver Queen</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Deity:</strong> Micheal, The Grim Blade</li>
                <p>The Silver Kingdom is known across the land as being a place of shadows and deceit. The Silver Kingdom isn't
                    necessarily evil nor good, they work only for themselves and their queen.</p>
