    <h1>The Races of Nevaria</h1>
    <p>Nevaria is home to a wildly diverse range of races with different physical and cultural characteristics as well as different sub-races
        in some cases. Some of these races were created by the gods and others were born from the abyss, others still were the effect of
        breeding between the races or magical interference.<br>

        Below is a list of the many races that inhabit Nevaria:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><h2>Elves</h2></dt>
        <dd>Elves come in one of the widest varieties of all the races of Nevaria. In general, elves are known for their slender and tall build,
            They are the direct descendents of the Fey gods and were the original inheritors of Nevaria. Because of their Fey ancestry, Elves are
            an immortal and generally super human race.<br><br>

            <h3>Sub-races of the Elves</h3>
            <ul><strong>The Dark Elves:</strong><p> The Dark Elves were one of the races spawned from the War of the Elves. They were spawned from
                    a curse that was cast upon them by the Fey as a punishment for their evil behaviour. They have forever warped into a
                    different variety of elf. They are known for their red or purple eyes and their intensely pale skin that has a strange
                    lavender hue to it at times. Dark Elves are sometimes also called Blood elves since many of them are known for vampirism.
                    Many Dark Elves still serve the Silver Queen as her loyal subjects and they often hold intense hatred against Frost Elves.</p>
                <strong>The Frost Elves:</strong><p> The Frost Elves were the other race spawned from the War of the Elves from the same curse that
                        warped the Dark Elves. The Frost Elves are known for their blue eyes and having pale skin with just a hint of light blue as
                        well giving them the a chilled look. Frost Elves require the blood of other creatures to survive, thus many of them are
                        vampiric in a similar vein to Dark Elves. Frost Elves possess superhuman strength and agility, making them terrible foes to face.</p>
                <strong>The Sand Elves:</strong><p> During the War of the Elves, the Sand Elves retreated to the southern deserts. After years in the desert
                        they adapted to the new environment. Their skin grew darker from the constant sun and they learned the mystic ways of the desert folk.
                        The Sand Elves are a race of fierce and noble warriors, always willing to help those in need and train curious travellers in the arts
                        of bladecasting and combat. The Sand Elves are known for defeating one of the vile desert wyrms when it attempted to destroy the desert
                        capital. Their reputation is a noble one among all the peoples of Nevaria.</p>
                <strong>The Wood Elves:</strong><p> The Wood Elves also fled during the War of the Elves, but they went into the forests of Nevaria. After years
                        in the forest they adapted to the new environment, their skin developing a sort of camouflage being less pale and with a tinge of green.
                        They are known for their connection with nature and mana. They protect the forests of Nevaria with magic and combat artistry. The wood elves
                        are the closest linked to the Fey and they preserve the ancient religion of the elves through oratory tradition. Many people of all races and
                        religions come to learn the beautiful arts of elven hymns, choir, and oration.</p>
                <strong>Rare Types of Elves:</strong><p>There are other types of Elves throughout Nevaria, but most of them are very rare. The Cosmic Elves come in
                        three varieties: Star, Moon, and Sun. Star Elves are the spawn of the Star god Saturnis. Sun Elves and Moon Elves are the result of breeding
                        between Star and Sand Elves and Star and Wood Elves accordingly. Other types of Elves have been reported to exist but there have been no
                        confirmations.</p></ul></dd>
